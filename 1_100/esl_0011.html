        <h1>Getting Ready for Bed and Going to Sleep</h1>
        <p>
            At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed.  When I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story.  I’m looking forward to having that ritual with my own kids someday.
<br />
            I go into the bathroom and turn on the tap.  I wash my face, and dry it with my towel.  I floss and brush my teeth.  I have to admit that by this time, I’m beat, and so is my wife.  She cleans up when I’ve finished up.
<br />
            In the meantime, I walk into the bedroom and get undressed.  I put my dirty clothes in the hamper and I put on my pajamas.  Wearing my slippers, I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water to put next to the bed in case I need it during the night.  I pull back the covers, fluff my pillow, and climb into bed.  I set my alarm clock for 6:15, and turn off the overhead light.  I lay my head down and pull up the covers, kissing my wife goodnight.  Some nights I have trouble falling asleep, but tonight, I didn’t need to count any sheep.  I nod off right away and before long, I’m fast asleep.
