        <h1>The Commute to Work</h1>
        <p>
            I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the back seat, and get comfortable for my drive.  I put my coffee mug into the cup holder, put the keys in the ignition, find the gas pedal, and start the car.  My wife drove the car last night, so I have to re-adjust the rear view mirror and the side mirrors.  I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report.  I take the transmission out of park and into reverse, back out into the driveway into the street, close the garage door, and put the car into drive.  I used to drive a stick shift, but as I get older, I like my automatic transmission more and more.
<br />
            I usually take the freeway to the office, so I get on the onramp for the freeway and drive to where I have to get off.  My office is only a few miles from the exit.  I pull into the parking garage, swiping my key card to get in.  I park, grab my briefcase and coffee, and head toward the elevator.  And that only took 40 minutes!
