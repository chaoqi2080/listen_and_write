        <h1>Taking Credit</h1>
        <p>
            <b> Jeff:</b> You're not going to believe what happened? <br />

            <b> Lucy:</b> Oh, is the big meeting over? What happened?<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Dan tried to take credit for our idea for the new campaign.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> You're kidding me! I thought he might try to pull something like this, but I didn't think he'd have the nerve to do that.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Yeah, and to top it off, he said that he did it all by himself.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> He's unbelievable. What a jerk! He slacks off for the last two weeks and doesn't lift a finger to help on any part of the project.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Well, he's not going to get away with it. I'm going to talk to the senior vice president. I think she'll listen.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Are you sure? I think she's fair-minded, but maybe she thinks we should work it out with Dan ourselves. She might not want to step in.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Well, can you think of another way to handle this?<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> I wish I could. I don't want to just blow it off, but we have to think of the fall out. Maybe the senior VP will end up thinking we can't fight our own battles.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Yeah, you're right. I'm just so ticked off right now I can't think.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> That's probably the problem. We both need to cool off so we can think straight. Let's get some coffee and see what we can come up with.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> That sounds good. But, if I see Dan on the way out, I'm going to floor that guy.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Yeah. That makes two of us.<br />
