        <h1>Introducing Yourself</h1>
        
        
        <p>Let me tell you a little about myself.
            <br/>I was born and raised in Minnesota and I’m a native of the city of Saint Paul. 
            I grew up there with my parents and my eight brothers and two sisters. 
            I’m the eleventh child so you could say I’m the baby of the family, but I swear I wasn’t spoiled.
            <br/>That’s right, I’m part of a big family, probably the biggest family in the neighborhood, 
            perhaps the biggest family in the state!
            <br/>I had a happy childhood, for the most part. My father and mother didn’t have a lot of money, 
            but because they both worked hard, we never felt deprived.
            <br/>I wasn’t much interested in sports, like my brothers were. I enjoyed reading and listening to music while growing up.
            I went to grade school near my house, and then to high school about two miles away from our home.
            <br/>After graduating from high school, I went on to the University of Minnesota for my bachelor’s degree. 
            It took me a while to learn the ropes at the university, but I finally graduated about six years later. 
            Better late than never, as my father used to say. <br/>
            I then went to Mexico for a couple of years to teach English and to study Spanish.
            When I returned, I decided to become a teacher, so I went back to school to get my master’s degree. 
            After teaching high school for a few years, I was offered a job in California, so I moved to Los Angeles in 1991. 
            After working here for a few years, I went back to school—(again!)—to get my Ph.D. 
            I was starting to become a professional student.<br/>
            Well, I completed my Ph.D. in four years and then taught at the university for several years. 
            Now, I work at a small research organization here in Los Angeles. 
            I am happily married, and I still enjoy reading and listening to music, and of course, creating ESLPod.com lessons.
