        <h1>Making Dinner, Eating Dinner</h1>
        <p>
            When I get home, I start on dinner right away.  I clean off the kitchen counter after putting away the groceries and decide to make pasta.  I preheat the oven to 375 to bake the bread and to keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home.  I put some water in a pan and turn the burner on high.  When the water starts boiling, I put in the pasta and decide to make a salad.  Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, “I’m home!”  She comes into the kitchen, and helps with chopping the tomatoes to add to the sauce.  She stirs the sauce until it’s done, while I finish tossing the salad.

            I get out the place mats and napkins to set the table.  I also make sure that there is a spoon, knife, fork, and plate for each of us.  About 15 minutes later, we sit down at the table in the dining room and talk about our long day.  My wife says she’ll do the dishes, since I cooked, but of course I help out by drying them.  First, I put some of the leftovers in a Tupperware container and some in plastic wrap and the rest in aluminum foil.  Then I dry the pans, plates, glasses, and silverware.
