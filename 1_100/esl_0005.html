        <h1>Getting Dressed & Ready for Work</h1>
        <p>
            I go back into my bedroom and open up closet door.  I have about 30 dress shirts, 10 pairs of pants, a half-dozen ties, and some sweaters, suit jackets, and t-shirts.  I pull out a clean pair of socks and underwear, and then decide which shirt I’m going to wear today.  I’m terrible at color coordinating, so I usually bring my wife in at this point to help match my shirt and pants.  I put on my belt with the silver buckle and polish my shoes.  I put my cell phone and car keys in my front pocket, and my wallet in the back one.
<br />
            I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and then go into the home office to get my bag.  I used to carry a more traditional briefcase, but now I just use my computer bag to hold my laptop and my papers.  Now it’s back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos on the way out the door.  I lock the door and then hurry to my car in the garage.  I’m usually running late and today is no exception!
