        <h1>Getting an Interview</h1>
        <p>
            I've finally landed my first interview. Well, actually, that's not really true. I have been on many interviews for part-time jobs. This was my first interview for a full-time job.
</p><p>
            In less than two months, I will graduate from Arizona University. After a lot of back and forth trying to decide on a major, I finally decided to double major. I would study both political science and marketing.
        </p><p>            
            These are not majors that usually go together. In fact, most people thought I was crazy. But, after a lot of soul searching, I decided to combine my two main interests: 1. politics and 2. getting a job! Those are my two priorities. I thought that if I got degrees in these two fields, I could cast a wide net when going job hunting. And, that's what I'm trying to do now.
        </p><p>  
            Since I don't know if I want to work in the public or private sector, I've applied for jobs in both. In the public sector, I could work for the government. Maybe one day, I could even be a speech writer for the president! Okay, maybe I should shoot a little lower.
        </p><p> 
            In the private sector, I could work for private organizations such as museums or schools. Some of those are non-profit. I could also work for a company. Everybody tells me that that's where you can make a lot of money. I haven't decided yet. I'm planning to apply for a lot of jobs and will see what happens. What I want now is just to get some job offers. Then, I can start to be picky.
