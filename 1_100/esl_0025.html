        <h1>A Trip to New York City</h1>
        <p>
            (The phone rings.) <br />

            <b> Lucy:</b> Hello. <br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Hey Lucy, it's Jeff.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Hey, welcome back. How was your vacation?<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Oh, it was great. The seven days in New York was a blast.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Oh, yeah? Did you do any sightseeing or just visit with friends?<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> I got to do both, actually. First, I saw my friend Edmundo who just moved there. He hadn't seen much of the city himself so we went to all the tourist spots. We got a guidebook and went to the major museums, saw a play, went to a concert in Central Park, and took the Staten Island Ferry. We did all of that in a day and a half. It was a whirlwind, but we got to see a lot.<br />
            <br />
            <b> Lucy:</b> A day and a half?! You guys must have been exhausted.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Yeah, we were. But, the rest of my trip was pretty low key. My friends Pat and Billie rented a car and we took a road trip to Upstate New York to visit some other friends of ours.<br />
            <br />
            <b> Lucy:</b> Did you have to stay over in a hotel along the way, or did you drive straight through?<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> We didn't bother with booking hotel rooms so we just drove straight there. It wasn't that far.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> How long did you stay there?<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> We were only there two days and we drove back and got back last night. My flight was this morning at 8 a.m. The worst part of the whole trip was that my flight was cancelled. I was rebooked onto another flight that had a three-hour layover in Chicago. That was a major pain.<br />
            <br />
            <b> Lucy:</b> It sounds like it. Well, I'm glad you made it back okay. And, you even have the weekend to rest up before work on Monday.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Yeah, I'll need it. I've got to catch up on my sleep!<br />
