        <h1>Problems at the Office</h1>
        <p>
            <b> Lucy:</b> Hey Jeff, can I pick your brain for a minute? <br />

            <b> Jeff:</b> Sure, what's up?<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Well, I have a sticky situation at work and I wanted to get your input. You're always so tactful.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Thanks. I'm not sure I can help but I'll give you my two cents.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Well, it's like this. There's this guy I work with who is always making jokes about the boss. Don't get me wrong. I like a good joke now and then, especially about the boss. But, sometimes he goes too far.<br />
            
            Jeff. What do you mean?<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Well, just the other day, he got a picture off the Internet and cut and pasted the boss's head onto it. Let's just say it was a very unflattering picture of him.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Hmm. That's really unprofessional, but it sounds harmless enough, if he kept it to himself or just showed it to a few friends.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> That's just it. He didn't keep it to himself. He attached the picture to an email and sent it to the entire company, including the top brass.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> You're joking, right?<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> No, I'm not. This is what I meant when I said he goes too far. He just doesn't know when to quit.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Is he a friend of yours?<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> No, not really. But, I don't want the guy to get fired. He's actually a good person. He's just clueless, that's all.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Well, that's a tough one. Let me think about it. Maybe there's a way to get him to cut it out before he gets fired.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Thanks. I appreciate it.<br />
            
            <b> Jeff:</b> Oh, it's no big deal. Let's go get a bite to eat.<br />
            
            <b> Lucy:</b> Sure. Sounds good to me.<br />
